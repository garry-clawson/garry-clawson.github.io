        <p><b>ABSTRACT</b><br>
        Both in an update to the brief, and in an official announcement of the changes - clear communication is necessary for remote study to be viable.  - The brief makes no mention of a cover page, even though the program leader has confirmed we should include one. - The brief states the proposal should include a "...review of project progress.", but the listed 7 sections do not account for such. How can we review progress made on a project that has not yet even been proposed?  It should also be noted that the cohort received the brief late (and - initially - partially incomplete), as defined by the opening statement "[...][briefs] should be made available prior to the commencement of the module [...]".
